# 📊 CodeAlpha_Stock_Portfolio_Tracker
A beginner-friendly Python script that helps you calculate your total stock investment based on manually entered stock names and quantities.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. You enter stock names (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
2. You provide how many shares you own.
3. The program uses a predefined stock price dictionary.
4. It calculates the total value and optionally saves it to a text file.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python (3.x)
- File Handling
- Dictionaries
- Basic I/O

## 🧪 Sample Run
(Only use stocks like AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT or modify dictonary)
Enter stock names and quantity (type 'done' to finish): Stock name: AAPL Quantity: 2 Stock name: TSLA Quantity: 1 Stock name: done

----- Portfolio Summary ----- AAPL: 2 x $180 = $360 TSLA: 1 x $250 = $250

Total Investment: $610

## 📁 Output File

A portfolio_summary.txt file will be created if you choose to save the output.
